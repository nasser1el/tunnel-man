# Tunnel Man
Tunnel Man is a clone of the popular arcade game, Dig Dug, built entirely through C++. 

The player begins with three lives and continues to play until all lives have been exhausted. During the game, the players must dig (by moving around using the WASD or arrow keys on your keyboard) and find all of the hidden barrels of oil within the field. As the player finishes each level, the game will get progressively harder, with a new unique oil field configuration each time as well as some zombies showing up in later levels. 

Players can find power-ups hidden in the oil field to help them throughout the game.

You can run this line of code from the executable directory on any Windows machine to demo Tunnel Man:
```
./TunnelMan.exe
```
